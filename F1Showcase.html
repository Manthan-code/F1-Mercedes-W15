       <p class="info">After a hard-fought run to second in the Constructors' Championship last year, the team emerged from 2023 and a period of 
        renewal stronger and more determined than ever. The W15, our 2024 challenger, improved some of the previous car's inherent 
        architectural limitations. After building an understanding of our new machine in the opening races, the team is now rapidly 
        bringing performance to the track and pushing us into the fight at the front.</p>
